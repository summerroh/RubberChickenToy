√ beep버튼누르면 소리나오게 하는중
√ null is not an object (evaluating 'RNSound.IsAndroid') 에러때문에 ㅠㅠㅠ Sound가 import가 안됨
-expo managed 로 개발중이기때문에 react native인 react native sound가 작동이안되면서 에러뜨는거엿음

√ react native sound 대신에 expo install expo-av 를 사용하기로 함

√ 일단 버튼 누르면 알람 뜨게는 함.. 오디오를 어떻게나오는지알아낸후 playsound 함수에 넣으면될듯

소리가 안남
